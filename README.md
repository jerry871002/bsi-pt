# Bayesian Strategy Inference plus Policy Tracking (BSI-PT)

This repository presents the BSI-PT algorithm introduced in the paper [Opponent Exploitation Based on Bayesian Strategy Inference and Policy Tracking](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148618).

BSI-PT is a Bayesian algorithm that can infer an opponent's policy in a multi-agent competitive environment. BSI-PT combines the advantages of inter-episode strategy inference and intra-episode policy tracking. Experiments have showed that BSI-PT is more accurate than other BPR variants at predicting the opponent's policy and winning against opponents with a variety of policy selection strategies.
